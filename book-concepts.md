# Some concepts
- **Nonspatial data**: describes how values are distributed.

- **Spatial analysis**: examines the relationships between features identified within a geographic boundary.

- Geospatial data allows us to comprehend the interconnectivity of all systems of the planed (identified by AGCI): atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and anthroposphere.

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** analyze data and display real-time geographic information. Although there are similarities between spatial and nonspatial analyses, spatial statistics are developed specifically for use with geographic data. Both are associated with geographic features, but spatial statistics look specifically at geocoded geographical spatial data.

- **Coordinate systems and Projections**: once the Earth's shape is an ellipsoid, when we attempt to map its surface to create a two-dimensional map, we use a geographic coordinate system (with latitude and longitude lines) to project that imperfect shape, that coordinate system, onto a flat surface. There are many types of projections: conic, azimuthal, Mercator, and so on. These projections, analyze, in different ways, the relationship between the Earth's surface with the two-dimensional surface.

- **Vectors data**: uses points, lines, and polygons to communicate data. It focuses on what is visible in a particular location. There are specific boundaries or areas on a map where data or objects are either present or absent.

  Geographical systems can work with many types of data. Vector data file designed as a shapefile - .shp (do not have a topological or spatial layer) or geodatabase - .gdb (topological or spatial layer are optional).

- **Rasters data**: is continuous data that lack specific boundaries but is present across the entire map view, such as imagery, surface temperature out digital elevation. Raster is data displayed as a pixelated image matrix, instead of the points, lines, and polygons of vector data. Each pixel corresponds to a specific geographical location. Raster data is represented as an array of values divided into a grid of cells (cells and pixels describe spatial resolution - the dimension of it represents the area being covered). Different from photos, raster images include data on the expanded bands of light wavelengths.
